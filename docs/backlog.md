# Backlog

Feature backlog and technical debt for Bulq development.

## 🚀 Critical: Production Readiness

These items must be completed before production deployment.

---

### Database Migrations with Alembic
**Status**: Critical (before production)
**Affected files**: New `alembic/` directory, `app/main.py`

**Problem:** Using `create_tables()` which can't handle schema changes. No migration history.

**Current limitations:**
- Can't add/remove/modify columns safely
- Can't track what schema version is deployed
- Can't roll back changes

**Solution:** Set up Alembic for database migrations:
```bash
alembic init alembic
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
alembic upgrade head
```

**Workflow:**
1. Modify models in `models.py`
2. Generate migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`
3. Review generated migration file
4. Apply: `alembic upgrade head`
5. Rollback if needed: `alembic downgrade -1`

Remove `create_tables()` call from `main.py` once migrations are in place.

### Security & Infrastructure
**Status**: Partially Complete
**Affected files**: `app/main.py`, `app/routes/auth.py`, `Caddyfile`, `docker-compose.yml`

**Still TODO:**

1. **Rate Limiting** - Use `slowapi` middleware:

   - Login/registration: 5 requests/minute
   - Bid placement: 20 requests/minute
   - General API: 100 requests/minute

2. **Database Backups** - Automated daily backups with pg_dump, S3 storage, retention policy
   - Manual backup script documented
   - Need automated backup to cloud storage
   - Need monitoring/alerting for backup failures
3. **Cache layer with redis**

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

---

### Caching & Performance
**Status**: Future
**Priority**: Medium
**Affected files**: Backend services, infrastructure

**Backend:**
- Cache store lists (rarely change)
- Cache product lists per store
- Use Redis with TTL and invalidation on updates

## 📝 Notes

- **Mobile App**: Native Kotlin Android app planned after web platform stable
