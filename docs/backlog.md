# Backlog

### Bugs

1. sometimes users can't edit during adjusting (possibly when they pressed ready during planning)

### Features
1. distribution groups for each run (split total into multiple pickup points)
3. Create buyers clubs and sellers clubs
9. **Leader Can Modify User Bids**
   - Leader has ability to edit other users' bids (not just force equal distribution)
   - Makes price division and quantity adjustments easier
   - Useful during adjusting stage for fine-tuning allocations
   - Note: This needs more design work to determine exact workflow and permissions
