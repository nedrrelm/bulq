# Backlog

Feature backlog for Bulq development.

## Run Management

### Allow users to progress a run
**Status**: Planned

Runs should be progressable through states (planning → active → confirmed → shopping → completed).

This would require acknowledgements from all users active in the run.

## Product Discovery

### Product page and search
**Status**: Planned

Shows comparable products in different stores, allowing users to:
- Search for products
- Compare prices across stores
- View product details

### Product families
**Status**: Planned

Allows using general terms (e.g., "rice") instead of specific variants (e.g., "sushi rice", "jasmine rice", "basmati rice").

This creates a hierarchy/grouping system for products.

## Price Tracking

### Product price history
**Status**: Planned

Every time someone visits a store they can note the current price of a product.

**Features**:
- Track prices over time
- Support multiple values per product (for cases like markets where different sellers price differently)
- Show a graph over time of price changes

## Run Pages

### Active run page
**Status**: Planned

Show shopping list with detailed tracking:
- Each item on the list
- Track prices for each item (can be multiple)
- Amount bought
- Price paid

### Completed run page
**Status**: Planned

Post-run settlement view showing:
- Who is supposed to get how much of what
- Who picked up their part
- Who paid how much
